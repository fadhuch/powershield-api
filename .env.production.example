# Production MongoDB Configuration
# Copy this to .env for production or set as environment variables in your hosting platform

# MongoDB Atlas Connection with SSL bypass for production issues
# Option 1: With SSL certificate bypass (for SSL issues)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/powershield?retryWrites=true&w=majority&ssl_cert_reqs=CERT_NONE&tlsInsecure=true

# Option 2: With relaxed SSL validation
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/powershield?retryWrites=true&w=majority&ssl=true&sslValidate=false

# Option 3: Standard connection (try this first)
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/powershield?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Database Configuration
DB_NAME=powershield
NODE_ENV=production

# Server Configuration (for traditional hosting, not needed for serverless)
PORT=5001

# Production Deployment Notes:
# 1. Replace 'username' and 'password' with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials
# 2. Replace 'cluster.mongodb.net' with your actual cluster URL
# 3. For Vercel/Netlify: Set these as environment variables in the dashboard
# 4. For other hosting: Use your platform's environment variable system
# 5. Never commit this file with real credentials to version control

# MongoDB Atlas Security Checklist:
# ✓ IP Whitelist: Add your server's IP or 0.0.0.0/0 for testing
# ✓ Database User: Has readWrite permissions on your database
# ✓ Cluster: Is running and not paused
# ✓ Region: Choose closest to your server for better performance
