# PowerShield Admin - JavaScript Build & Deployment Guide

## Build Issues Fixed

The project has been successfully converted from TypeScript to JavaScript and from Create React App to Vite to resolve build issues with Vercel. Here are the main changes made:

### Changes Made:

1. **Converted from TypeScript to JavaScript**:
   - Renamed all `.tsx` files to `.jsx` files
   - Renamed all `.ts` files to `.js` files  
   - Removed TypeScript interfaces and type annotations
   - Removed TypeScript configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`)
   - Removed TypeScript dependencies from `package.json`

2. **Converted from CRA to Vite**:
   - Removed `react-scripts` dependency
   - Added Vite and `@vitejs/plugin-react`
   - Updated `package.json` scripts
   - Created `index.html` in root directory
   - Updated build configuration for Vite

3. **Updated Dependencies**:
   - Removed TypeScript-related packages (`@types/*`, `typescript`)
   - Updated build and development scripts
   - Moved testing dependencies to `devDependencies`

3. **Created Vercel Configuration**:
   - Added `vercel.json` with proper build settings
   - Updated `.gitignore` for Vite build artifacts

### Build Commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run tests
npm run test
```

### Vercel Deployment:

The project is now configured to build properly on Vercel with:
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `dist`
- Framework: Vite

### Project Structure:

- `index.html` - Main HTML file (in root directory, references `src/index.jsx`)
- `src/index.jsx` - Main React entry point (JavaScript)
- `src/` - Source code (all JavaScript/JSX files)
- `public/` - Static assets
- `dist/` - Build output (generated by Vite)
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration

### Environment Variables:

The project uses environment variables for API configuration:
- `VITE_API_URL` - API endpoint (configured in `vite.config.js`)

### Notes:

- The build now uses Vite instead of Create React App for faster builds and better performance
- All static assets from `public/` are now served from the root path
- TypeScript compilation is handled by Vite
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is available in development mode

## Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any build issues:

1. Clear node_modules and reinstall:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. Clear Vite cache:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   ```

3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly

The project should now build successfully on Vercel and other deployment platforms.
